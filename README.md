# Data-Visualization-and-State-Prediction-using-Bayesian-Inference-with-Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
In this project, the state of the object is predicted using Bayesian Inference Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. For Data visualization, I used Matplotlib to correctly observe the Convergence to Stationary Distribution by plotting Histogram and Bar Charts. Successfully achieved low Mean Squared Error of 0.0003 for various test cases involving prior-posterior probability.
